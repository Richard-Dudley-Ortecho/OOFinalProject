# Object Oriented Final Project - CSCI 4448

Made By: Andrea Chamorro, Luke Joyce, Richard Ortecho

Project Title: Restaurant Tycoon - A Unity Game

### Description
Description: Our game made and coded in the Unity Engine draws inspiration from the previous assignment involving rolls and customers ordering them. It is a game where you start your day and a customer comes and orders a roll! This Unity game has been exported to use Google Cardboard and works on Android phones as a full game.

### Our Code
This project borrows a lot of premade assets and materials from other sources, but the code is our own. This code can be found at OOFinalProject/Assets/_Scripts. In Unity each "script" is attached to an object and connections to other objects can be made in the editor of the game. So many references in our code, while declared, were set in the unity editor instead of the code. Regardless we have a lot of moving parts, but the CS (C#) scripts should have the format *.cs

### To Run:
An Android .apk is provided called FinalOO.apk in the home directory. Download this to an Android phone and click install (if you are having an error downloading from a 'Unknown Sources' follow the instructions on this website, https://www.wikihow.com/Allow-Apps-from-Unknown-Sources-on-Android). This will install a Unity app with the Google Cardboard VR game and have the app on your phone. Feel free to play after by looking around and tapping!

As an alernative, if you have Unity Downloaded, simply clone the repository and have the Unity hub recognize it as a project. Open the project and choose the scene "Garden + Kitchen copy" under OOFinalProject/Assets/_Scenes. The follow the instructions on this website to enable a renderpipeline https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.0/manual/configuring-universalrp-for-use.html. And then click the play button. Using alt and click to move around the scene.
